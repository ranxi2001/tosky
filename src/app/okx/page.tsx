## 📱 2. Download the App

### iOS Download
    - Go to Taobao/Xianyu and purchase a "foreign Apple ID" for a few RMB.
    - Sign in to the foreign Apple ID, search **OKX** in the App Store, and install it.
    - This same ID also lets you download Twitter, Telegram, and other apps.

### Android Download
1. On the official website registration page, click the three bars in the upper right → scroll to the bottom and tap "Download OKX App".
2. If installation fails:
    - **Huawei**: Turn off "Pure Mode" and "External Source App Check"
    - **Xiaomi**: On the install screen, tap the upper right settings icon and enable "Security Protection"
    - **OPPO**: Disable "Payment Protection", install the app, then re-enable it

## 💰 3. Introduction to Strategy Trading

Strategy trading = using programs to automatically execute your trading plans.

**Advantages:**
    - Automatic monitoring with strict stop-loss and take-profit
    - Diversifies risk and improves efficiency
    - One-click trading for beginners, advanced customization for pros
    - No extra management fees or profit-sharing

**Supports multiple market conditions:**
    - Range-bound and volatile markets
    - Bull markets (uptrend)
    - Bear markets (downtrend)
    - Grid strategies adaptable to all scenarios

## 🔑 4. Official Rebate Benefits

    - Entering the invitation code grants you a lifetime 20% official rebate (20% fee discount).
    - If you skip this step, you get no rebate. Any promises of over 20% rebate are scams.
    - Be sure to confirm your rebate binding after registration.

## 🌟 5. Frequently Asked Questions

> **Is Bitcoin legal in China?**

According to the 2013 joint notice by the People’s Bank of China and four other ministries:

> “Bitcoin is a specific virtual commodity. It does not have legal tender status or mandatory acceptance. Individuals participate at their own risk.”

So it is legal for individuals to hold and trade virtual assets.
